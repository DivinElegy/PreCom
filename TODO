Streaming to peekingboo etc is a TASK not a service,

remove the psexec stuff from stream.sh to a new script that just calls psexec (might not even need a script, just do it as the task)

add a new widget, progressbox. Can pipe stuff in to it (adapter just has to echo out what it's doing. e.g., my-adapter.sh | dialog --title fff --progressbox
